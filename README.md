This is a project that involves the full process of data cleaning in Excel all the way to create an Excel friendly dashboard. 

In this project I:

Conducted data cleaning to remove duplicates and handle missing values.
Created visualizations (bar charts, line charts) to represent key variables like age, marital status, and
location.
Implemented interactive filters to enable users to explore data based on specific attributes.
Organized the dashboard to provide a clear overview of bike sales data and key metrics.
